### What is this repository for? ###

This is a basic project to practice HTML5 API Canvas and some Javascript.
Intended for high resolution displays (1920 X 1080 recomended) this app allows you to add beautiful
firework effects and some selected image filters to your favourite pictures.
When you are done editing you can download the resulting image to your computer on .jpg format.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Dowload the full folder and place it to your desired server service (local or remote)

* Enjoy!

### Contribution guidelines ###

* Clean code
* Cool ideas
* NO variable renaming; most of them are named in English, and you can easily figure out the rest or just ask me for more info.
* NO function messing, what's done is done, build your own functions and ask me if you think some of mine can/should be tweaked.
* Communication
